In order to get a clear idea of catering and inventories for the following few months, you would have to make a list of things to keep in mind. First, you have to assume that every cake costs about 10 dollars. Next, you need a clear idea of how many people are going to be ordering, so you assume it’s between 9 and 13. Additionally, not every day is the same, so you have to assume that the progress/business of one day doesn’t affect the other (aka independent). Last, regardless of data, you are required to bake 5 cakes a day for display, 4 days a week for a total of 10 weeks for 200 total. \n",
